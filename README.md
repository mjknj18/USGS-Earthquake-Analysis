# USGS-Earthquake-Analysis

The goal of this project was to use JavaScript to present an interactive map visualization of USGS earthquake data within a web page. Since the baseline data was provided in GeoJSON format, Leaflet was used to import and process the data, as well as generate the required visualization.
